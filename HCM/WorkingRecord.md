## 📋 Overview

This guide explains xTalent's **Working Record (WR) Processing Model** - a comprehensive event-driven approach to tracking, aggregating, and reporting employment lifecycle changes.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide builds upon the **Universal Business Event Framework** defined in the [Global Business Event Ontology](../../../00-global/ontology/business-event.yaml). The Business Event framework provides the platform-wide event infrastructure that powers working records across all xTalent modules.

### What You'll Learn

- Understanding working records and their role in HCM
- Event-driven architecture for employment tracking
- How system events aggregate into working records
- Working record structure and organization
- Worker-level aggregation and reporting
- Real-world employment lifecycle examples

### Key Concepts

**Working Record (WR)**: A comprehensive, chronological log of all meaningful employment-related events for an employee, maintained as a single continuous timeline per employment relationship.

**Event**: Any significant change in an employee's employment data (hire, promotion, transfer, compensation change, termination, etc.)

**WR Line**: A single working record timeline for one `employee_code` (one employment relationship)

**Worker Aggregation**: The ability to view all WR lines across all employment relationships for a single worker

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Event-Driven Foundation

xTalent adopts an **event-sourcing inspired** approach where:

```
All Data Changes → Generate Events → Events Build Working Records
```

**Philosophy**: 
- Every employment change is captured as an immutable event
- Events are the source of truth
- Working records are derived aggregations of events
- Complete audit trail is maintained automatically

### 2. One WR Line Per Employee Code

```
Employee Code (EMP-2024-001) → One WR Line
  ├─ Event 1: Hire (2024-01-01)
  ├─ Event 2: Probation End (2024-03-01)
  ├─ Event 3: Promotion (2024-07-01)
  ├─ Event 4: Transfer (2024-10-01)
  └─ Event 5: Compensation Increase (2024-12-01)
```

**Key Points**:
- Each `employee_code` maintains **exactly one** working record line
- The WR line spans the entire employment relationship duration
- Events are ordered chronologically
- Both current and historical states are preserved

### 3. Worker-Level Aggregation

```
Worker (WORKER-001: Nguyễn Văn An)
  │
  ├─ WR Line 1: Employee Code EMP-2020-015 (First Employment)
  │   ├─ Start: 2020-01-01
  │   ├─ Events: 25 events
  │   └─ End: 2022-12-31 (Resigned)
  │
  └─ WR Line 2: Employee Code EMP-2024-050 (Rehire)
      ├─ Start: 2024-01-01
      ├─ Events: 8 events
      └─ End: null (Active)
```

**Capabilities**:
- View complete employment history across all employments
- Aggregate tenure calculations
- Cross-employment analytics and reporting
- Comprehensive audit trail

### Three-Layer Architecture

#### Layer 1: Event Generation Layer

**Purpose**: Capture every employment-related change as an immutable event

**Event Sources**:
- Hire/Termination actions
- Job assignment changes (promotion, transfer, demotion)
- Compensation changes
- Contract modifications
- Leave of absence start/end
- Work location changes
- Reporting relationship changes
- Personal data updates

**Event Structure**:
```yaml
Event:
  event_id: UUID
  event_type: "PROMOTION"
  event_category: "JOB_ASSIGNMENT"
  employee_id: UUID
  worker_id: UUID
  timestamp: "2024-07-01T09:00:00Z"
  effective_date: "2024-07-01"
  actor_id: UUID  # Who made the change
  
  # Event-specific payload
  payload:
    previous_job_id: "JOB-SENIOR-ENG"
    new_job_id: "JOB-LEAD-ENG"
    previous_grade: "G3"
    new_grade: "G4"
    reassignment_id: "ASG-2024-050"
    reason_code: "PERFORMANCE"
    
  metadata:
    approval_workflow_id: UUID
    approved_by: UUID
    approved_at: "2024-06-28T15:30:00Z"
    ip_address: "192.168.1.100"
    user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0..."
```

#### Layer 2: Event Aggregation Layer

**Purpose**: Transform chronological events into structured working records

**Aggregation Rules**:

1. **Event Filtering**: Determine which events affect working records
```yaml
Configured Event Types:
  - HIRE
  - TERMINATION
  - PROMOTION
  - DEMOTION
  - TRANSFER
  - COMPENSATION_CHANGE
  - CONTRACT_CHANGE
  - LEAVE_START
  - LEAVE_END
  - POSITION_CHANGE
  - LOCATION_CHANGE
  - REPORTING_CHANGE
```

2. **Event Ordering**: Chronological by `effective_date`, then `timestamp`

3. **State Calculation**: Derive current state from event sequence
```
Initial State (Hire) + Event 1 + Event 2 + ... + Event N = Current State
```

4. **Snapshot Creation**: Generate point-in-time state views
```yaml
Snapshot (as of 2024-07-01):
  employee_code: "EMP-2024-001"
  job_id: "JOB-LEAD-ENG"
  grade: "G4"
  business_unit_id: "BU-ENGINEERING"
  supervisor_id: "ASG-MGR-005"
  base_salary: 120000000
  location_id: "LOC-HCM-HQ"
  status: "ACTIVE"
```

#### Layer 3: Working Record Presentation Layer

**Purpose**: Provide queryable, reportable view of employment history

**Working Record Structure**:
```yaml
WorkingRecord:
  wr_id: UUID
  employee_id: UUID
  employee_code: "EMP-2024-001"
  worker_id: UUID
  
  # Employment span
  employment_start_date: "2024-01-01"
  employment_end_date: null
  is_current: true
  
  # Event timeline
  events:
    - event_id: "EVT-001"
      event_type: "HIRE"
      effective_date: "2024-01-01"
      summary: "Hired as Junior Engineer"
    
    - event_id: "EVT-012"
      event_type: "PROBATION_END"
      effective_date: "2024-03-01"
      summary: "Probation period completed"
    
    - event_id: "EVT-025"
      event_type: "PROMOTION"
      effective_date: "2024-07-01"
      summary: "Promoted to Lead Engineer (G3→G4)"
  
  # Current state (derived from events)
  current_state:
    job_id: "JOB-LEAD-ENG"
    business_unit_id: "BU-ENGINEERING"
    grade: "G4"
    base_salary: 120000000
    employment_status: "ACTIVE"
  
  # Statistics
  total_events: 15
  years_of_service: 0.95
  last_change_date: "2024-12-01"
```

## 🔄 Event-to-Working-Record Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Event Generation

**Trigger**: User performs an action (HR admin promotes an employee)

```yaml
Action: Promote employee EMP-2024-001
Input:
  employee_id: "EMP-2024-001"
  new_job_id: "JOB-LEAD-ENG"
  new_grade: "G4"
  effective_date: "2024-07-01"
  reason: "Exceptional performance"
```

**System**: Creates immutable event

```yaml
Event Generated:
  event_id: "EVT-2024-07-01-001"
  event_type: "PROMOTION"
  event_category: "JOB_ASSIGNMENT"
  employee_id: "EMP-2024-001"
  worker_id: "WORKER-001"
  created_at: "2024-06-28T10:00:00Z"
  effective_date: "2024-07-01"
  
  payload:
    previous_job_id: "JOB-SENIOR-ENG"
    new_job_id: "JOB-LEAD-ENG"
    previous_grade: "G3"
    new_grade: "G4"
    previous_assignment_id: "ASG-001"
    new_assignment_id: "ASG-002"
    reason_code: "PERFORMANCE"
```

#### Step 2: Event Storage

**System**: Persists event to event store

```sql
INSERT INTO hr_events.employment_event (
  event_id,
  event_type,
  employee_id,
  worker_id,
  effective_date,
  payload,
  created_at
) VALUES (...)
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Immutable (no updates or deletes)
- ✅ Append-only log
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Source of truth

#### Step 3: Working Record Update

**System**: Aggregates event into working record

```yaml
Before Update (WR for EMP-2024-001):
  events: [EVT-001, EVT-002, ..., EVT-024]  # 24 events
  current_state:
    job_id: "JOB-SENIOR-ENG"
    grade: "G3"
    
After Update:
  events: [EVT-001, EVT-002, ..., EVT-024, EVT-025]  # 25 events
  current_state:
    job_id: "JOB-LEAD-ENG"
    grade: "G4"
  last_change_date: "2024-07-01"
```

#### Step 4: State Snapshot (Optional)

**System**: Can create point-in-time snapshot for performance

```yaml
Snapshot @ 2024-07-01:
  snapshot_id: "SNAP-2024-07-01-001"
  employee_id: "EMP-2024-001"
  snapshot_date: "2024-07-01"
  
  state:
    job_id: "JOB-LEAD-ENG"
    grade: "G4"
    business_unit_id: "BU-ENGINEERING"
    base_salary: 120000000
    location_id: "LOC-HCM-HQ"
    supervisor_assignment_id: "ASG-MGR-005"
    employment_status: "ACTIVE"
```

**Purpose**:
- Fast queries "What was this employee's state on date X?"
- Avoid recalculating from events for historical queries
- Performance optimization for reporting

## 👤 Working Record Organization

### One WR Line Per Employee Code

**Concept**: Each `employee_code` (representing one employment relationship) has exactly one working record line.

#### Example: Single Employment

```yaml
Worker: WORKER-001 (Nguyễn Văn An)
  └─ Employee: EMP-2024-001
      └─ Working Record Line:
          wr_id: "WR-2024-001"
          employee_code: "EMP-2024-001"
          employment_start: "2024-01-01"
          employment_end: null
          
          events:
            - EVT-001: HIRE (2024-01-01)
            - EVT-002: PROBATION_END (2024-03-01)
            - EVT-003: PROMOTION (2024-07-01)
            - EVT-004: SALARY_INCREASE (2024-12-01)
```

#### Example: Multiple Employments (Rehire)

```yaml
Worker: WORKER-002 (Trần Thị Bình)
  │
  ├─ Employee: EMP-2020-050 (First Employment)
  │   └─ Working Record Line 1:
  │       wr_id: "WR-2020-050"
  │       employee_code: "EMP-2020-050"
  │       employment_start: "2020-01-01"
  │       employment_end: "2022-12-31"
  │       
  │       events:
  │         - EVT-100: HIRE (2020-01-01)
  │         - EVT-101: PROMOTION (2021-01-01)
  │         - EVT-102: TRANSFER (2022-06-01)
  │         - EVT-103: TERMINATION (2022-12-31)
  │
  └─ Employee: EMP-2024-075 (Rehire)
      └─ Working Record Line 2:
          wr_id: "WR-2024-075"
          employee_code: "EMP-2024-075"
          employment_start: "2024-01-01"
          employment_end: null
          
          events:
            - EVT-200: HIRE (2024-01-01)
            - EVT-201: SALARY_INCREASE (2024-07-01)
```

**Key Insights**:
- Same worker (WORKER-002) has **two separate WR lines**
- Each WR line corresponds to one `employee_code`
- Complete history is preserved for each employment
- Can aggregate across both WR lines at worker level

### Worker-Level Aggregation

**Purpose**: View complete employment history across all employment relationships

#### Aggregated View

```yaml

    EVT-201 (2024-07-01): SALARY_INCREASE
    ...
  ]
```

#### Aggregate Analytics

```yaml
Queries Enabled by Worker-Level Aggregation:

1. Total Service Time:
   "How many years has this worker been with the company?"
   → 3.95 years (across 2 employments)

2. Promotion History:
   "How many times has this worker been promoted?"
   → 3 times (2 in first employment, 1 in current)

3. Career Progression:
   "What was the career path?"
   → Junior (2020) → Senior (2021) → Lead (2024)

4. Compensation History:
   "What is the salary progression?"
   → 50M (2020) → 80M (2021) → 100M (2022) → 120M (2024)

5. Rehire Analysis:
   "Was this a successful rehire?"
   → Yes: Higher position (Lead vs Senior) and grade (G4 vs G3)
```

  - Calculate duration: employment_end_date - employment_start_date
  - Group by termination_type
  - Calculate averages

Results:
  VOLUNTARY_RESIGNATION: 2.3 years average
  INVOLUNTARY_TERMINATION: 1.1 years average
  RETIREMENT: 15.5 years average
  END_OF_CONTRACT: 1.8 years average
```

#### Promotion Velocity

```yaml
Analysis: "Time to first promotion by hire grade"

Data Source: Working Record events

Query Logic:
  - Find all HIRE events
  - Find first PROMOTION event for same employee_code
  - Calculate time difference
  - Group by hire grade

Results:
  Hired at G1: 18 months average to G2
  Hired at G2: 24 months average to G3
  Hired at G3: 30 months average to G4
```

#### Rehire Success Rate

```yaml
Analysis: "Rehire performance comparison"

Data Source: Workers with multiple WR lines

Metrics:
  - Average grade at first employment end: G2.5
  - Average grade at rehire: G3.2
  - Grade improvement: +0.7 levels
  - Promotion rate post-rehire: 65% (vs 45% overall)
  - Retention rate: 85% after 2 years (vs 70% overall)
  
Conclusion: Rehired employees perform better on average
```

## 🔧 Configuration and Customization

### Configurable Event Types

Organizations can configure which events generate working record entries:

```yaml
Working Record Configuration:

# Core Events (Always Tracked)
core_events:
  - HIRE
  - TERMINATION
  - PROMOTION
  - DEMOTION

# Optional Events (Configurable)
optional_events:
  - TRANSFER:
      enabled: true
      threshold: "cross_bu_only"  # Only track cross-BU transfers
  
  - SALARY_INCREASE:
      enabled: true
      threshold: ">= 10%"  # Only track increases >= 10%
  
  - LOCATION_CHANGE:
      enabled: false  # Not tracked in WR
  
  - REPORTING_CHANGE:
      enabled: true
      threshold: "senior_level_only"  # Only for G4+
  
  - LEAVE_START:
      enabled: true
      threshold: ">= 30 days"  # Only leaves >= 30 days
  
  - CONTRACT_AMENDMENT:
      enabled: true
      threshold: "material_changes_only"

# Event Retention Policy
retention:
  event_store:
    duration: "7 years"  # Legal compliance
    archive_after: "3 years"
  
  working_records:
    active_employees: "unlimited"
    terminated_employees: "7 years"
    purge_after: "10 years"  # GDPR compliance
```

### Snapshot Strategy

```yaml
Snapshot Configuration:

strategy: "hybrid"  # Options: none, periodic, on_demand, hybrid

periodic_snapshots:
  enabled: true
  frequency: "monthly"  # Create snapshot on 1st of each month
  retention: "24 months"

on_demand_snapshots:
  enabled: true
  triggers:
    - "TERMINATION"
    - "END_OF_YEAR"
    - "PROMOTION to G5+"

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Event Design

**✅ DO**:
- Make events immutable (append-only)
- Include all context needed to understand the change
- Use clear, descriptive event types
- Capture actor (who made the change)
- Store both previous and new values

**❌ DON'T**:
- Delete or modify historical events
- Store sensitive data in event payload (use references)
- Create overly granular events (e.g., every field change)
- Omit effective dates

### 2. Working Record Maintenance

**✅ DO**:
- Rebuild WR from events if inconsistencies detected
- Validate event sequences for logical consistency
- Create snapshots for performance-critical queries
- Archive old events to cold storage

**❌ DON'T**:
- Manually edit working records (always go through events)
- Allow gaps in event sequences
- Delete working records for terminated employees prematurely

### 3. Query Optimization

**✅ DO**:
- Use snapshots for historical point-in-time queries
- Cache current state for active employees
- Create indexes on effective_date and event_type
- Use worker-level aggregation for cross-employment analytics

**❌ DON'T**:
- Replay all events for every query
- Run complex aggregations on raw event data without indexes
- Query event store directly for user-facing features

### 4. Compliance and Audit

**✅ DO**:
- Retain events for legal compliance period (7+ years)
- Implement proper access controls on event data
- Log all access to sensitive working records
- Support data portability (GDPR right to access)
- Implement right to erasure with proper retention

**❌ DON'T**:
- Expose raw event data to end users
- Purge events before legal retention period
- Allow unauthorized modification of working records

## 🎓 Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All employment changes generate immutable events that become the source of truth

2. **One WR Line Per Employee Code**: Each employment relationship (employee_code) maintains exactly one working record line with complete event history

3. **Worker-Level Aggregation**: View consolidated history across all employment relationships for a single worker

4. **Configurable Tracking**: Organizations define which events matter for working records based on business needs

5. **Complete Audit Trail**: Full history is preserved automatically through event sourcing

6. **Flexible Reporting**: Query point-in-time states, analyze trends, track career progression, and generate compliance reports

### Benefits

✅ **Complete Employment History**: Every change is captured and preserved  
✅ **Audit Compliance**: Immutable event log satisfies regulatory requirements
