## 8. Business Rules

### Data Visibility Rules
- **Self-service**: Employees can view their own full profile, with compensation shown as statements (not raw figures unless configured)
- **Manager view**: Managers can view direct reports' profiles with position-relevant data
- **HR Admin**: Full access to all employee data within their scope
- **Cross-WR visibility**: Worker-level data shared across all WRs; assignment data is WR-specific

### Multiple WR Handling
- Primary WR is auto-selected on first view
- WR Switcher shows status indicators (Active/Inactive/Historical)
- Switching WR only affects Assignment section; Worker data remains constant
- Historical WRs are viewable but marked distinctly

### Action Availability
- Quick actions are context-sensitive based on employee status and viewer role
- Terminated employees show limited actions (view history only)
- Actions requiring approval show approval indicator

## 9. Integration Points

### Entry Points
- Global Search results → Employee 360
- Org Chart click → Employee 360
- Team list click → Employee 360
- Working Records → Employee 360

### Exit Points (Navigation)
- Manager name → Manager's Employee 360
- Department → Business Unit detail
- Position → Position detail
- Org Chart → Interactive org visualization
- Quick Action → Respective workflow

## 10. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Page Load Time | < 2s | Initial profile load with summary |
| Data Coverage | 100% | All entity data accessible |
| Role Accuracy | > 99% | Correct data visibility per role |
| Action Completion | > 70% | Quick actions lead to completion |
| User Satisfaction | > 85% | NPS for finding information |

### 11.11 Next Steps

1. **Tạo Composite API** (`GET /employees/360/{id}`) để orchestrate dữ liệu từ các layer
2. **Coordinate với module khác** để hoàn thiện APIs:
   - Time & Attendance: Leave balances, attendance summary
   - Performance Management: Ratings, goals, review scheduling
   - Benefits: Enrollment status
3. **Tạo Flow document** (`employee-360-view.flow.md`) để mô tả orchestration logic
4. **Tạo API Spec** cho composite endpoint với full request/response schema
